\title{patternize - An R package for quantifying color pattern variation.}
\description{
Quantifying variation in color patterns to study and compare the consistency of their expression
necessitates the homologous alignment and color-based segmentation of images. Patternize is an R
package that quantifies variation in color patterns as obtained from image data. Patternize
defines homology between pattern positions across specimens either through fixed landmarks or
image registration. Pattern identification is performed by categorizing the distribution of
colors using either an RGB threshold or an unsupervised image segmentation. The quantification
of the color patterns can be visualized as heat maps and compared between sets of samples.
}
\section{patternize main functions}{


The package has six main functions depending on how you want the alignment of the iamges and
the color extraction to be performed.

\code{patLanRGB} \cr
   Aligns images by transformations obtained from fixed landmarks and extracts colors using
   a predefined RGB values and cutoff value.

\code{patLanK} \cr
   Aligns images by transformations obtained from fixed landmarks and extracts colors using
   k-means clustering.

\code{patLanW} \cr
   Aligns images by transformations obtained from fixed landmarks and extracts color
   patterns by watershed segmentation using \code{\link[imager]{imager}} utilities.

\code{patRegRGB} \cr
   Aligns images using \code{\link[RNiftyReg]{niftyreg}} utilities for automated image
   registration and extracts colors using a predefined RGB values and cutoff value.

\code{patRegK} \cr
   Aligns images using \code{\link[RNiftyReg]{niftyreg}} utilities for automated image
   registration and extracts colors using k-means clustering.

\code{patRegW} \cr
   Aligns images using \code{\link[RNiftyReg]{niftyreg}} utilities for automated image
   registration and extracts color patterns by watershed segmentation using
   \code{\link[imager]{imager}} utilities.
}

\section{patternize preprocessing functions}{


The input for the main patternize functions are \code{RasterStack} objects and when landmark
transformation is used, landmark arrays.

\code{makeList} \cr
   This function returns a list of RasterStacks or a list of landmarks depending on the input
   provided.

\code{sampleLandmarks} \cr
   Sample landmarks in an image.

\code{lanArray} \cr
   This function creates a landmark array as used by \code{\link[Morpho]{procSym}} in the
   package \code{Morpho}.
}

\section{patternize postprocessing functions}{


\code{sumRaster} \cr
   This function sums the individual color pattern rasters as obtained by the main patternize
   functions.

\code{plotHeat} \cr
   Plots the color pattern heatmaps from \code{sumRaster} output.

\code{patPCA} \cr
   This function transforms the individual color pattern rasters as obtained by the main
   patternize functions to a dataframe of 0 and 1 values that can be used for Principal
   Component Analysis (\code{\link[stats]{prcomp}}). This function also allows to plot the
   analysis including a visualization of the shape changes along the axis.

\code{patRDA} \cr
   This function transforms the individual color pattern rasters as obtained by the main
   patternize functions to a dataframe of 0 and 1 values that can be used for constrained
   Redundancy Analysis (\code{\link[vegan]{rda}}). This function also allows to plot the
   analysis including a visualization of the shape changes along the axis.

\code{patArea} \cr
   This fucntion calculates the area in which the color pattern is expressed in each sample
   as the relative proportion using the provided outline of the considered trait or structure.
}

\section{patternize miscellaneous functions}{


\code{redRes} \cr
   Reduces the resolution of the \code{RasterStack} objects to speed up analysis.

\code{kImage} \cr
   Performs k-means clustering of images.

\code{sampleRGB} \cr
   Interactive function to sample RGB value from pixel or area in an image.

\code{createTarget} \cr
   Creates an artificial target images using a provided outline that can be used for image
   registration (experimantal).

\code{maskOutline} \cr
   Intersects a RasterStack with an outline. Everything outside of the outline will be removed
   from the raster.

\code{colorChecker} \cr
   Calibrate images using ColorChecker.
