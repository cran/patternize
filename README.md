Quantifying variation in color patterns to study and compare the consistency of their expression necessitates the homologous alignment and color-based segmentation of images. Patternize is an R package that quantifies variation in color patterns as obtained from image data. Patternize defines homology between pattern positions across specimens either through fixed landmarks or image registration. Pattern identification is performed by categorizing the distribution of colors using either an RGB threshold or an unsupervised image segmentation. The quantification of the color patterns can be visualized as heat maps and compared between sets of samples.
